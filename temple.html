    <h1>Temple Jewellery</h1>
    <img src="images/temp.jpg">

    <p>Temple jewellery refers to those pieces of jewellery that Bharatnatyam dancers wear. The inspiration for this
    jewellery comes from the ornaments and pieces of jewellery that one uses for decking up the South Indian idols of
    Hindu goddesses and gods. The temple jewellery uses silver for its construction and then the jewellery is
    gold-plated.</p>

<p>Stones like emeralds, pearls, rubies, and white sapphires are also studded in this jewellery. There are different
    types of temple jewellery, and some of them are simple Necklaces, vankis, jadai anagrams, nose-pins, bills, etc.
    Temple pieces of jewellery can be affordable as well as expensive, depending on their type.</p>
