    <p>Fashion jewellery is also known as custom jewellery. They are very trendy and makes one look fashionable. Faux
    jewellery and junk jewellery are all fashion jewellery. They are inexpensive, and people wear these on a regular
    basis. They complement your outfit and are extremely demanding.</p>

</p>Even teenagers wear this jewellery without the constant fear of losing them since they are cheaper than fine
    jewellery. Made with cheap metals and stones, fashion jewellery has the potential of carrying out your entire look.
    They are simple and gorgeous, and everyone loves these pieces of jewellery.</p>
