    <h1>Antique Jewellery</h1>
    <img src="images/an.jpg">
    <p>The use of the term antique jewellery is often interchangeable with the term vintage jewellery. But, they are
        different, and the main difference between them is their period. Antique jewellery, if traced back, is at least
        100 years old, whereas vintage is approximately 50 years old.</p>

        <p>People consider antique jewellery as a classic that can never get boring or old. They are extremely precious and
        rare, and hence nobody wears antique jewellery regularly. The sale of antique jewellery is not something one can
        see every day. It is very rare and occasionally done.</p>

        <p>These pieces of jewellery are extremely expensive, and the basis of their price is the metal one uses to make
        it. The precious stones and gems are also considered while calculating the price.</p>
